# Network Security Threat & Anomaly Detection (Capstone)

This capstone project builds an end-to-end threat detection framework using supervised and unsupervised machine learning on real-world network traffic datasets. It integrates bivariate/multivariate statistical analysis, dimensionality reduction, and clustering to detect anomalies and identify attack patterns for intrusion detection systems (IDS).

## üß† Project Objective

To detect and characterize cyberattack anomalies in network traffic using both labeled and unlabeled data. The project aims to model threats from different angles: user behavior, packet-level data, and full attack sequences.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
- Clustering: Silhouette Score, Visual PCA Clusters
- PCA: Variance explained and component inspection

---

## üí° Key Findings

- **PCA** helped reveal cluster structure and variance drivers across all datasets.
- **KNN & Gradient Boosting** showed strong classification performance in supervised settings.
- **DBSCAN** effectively identified high-density anomalies but was sensitive to `eps` and `min_samples`.
- **UNSW-NB15** produced highest classification accuracy (~87%) with LightGBM.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Class imbalance not fully resolved in some classifiers
- Clustering interpretability limited without feature attribution
- DBSCAN parameter sensitivity not thoroughly grid searched
